results|172.31.7|172.31.7.211|general/tcp|10201|Security Warning|\nThe remote host uses non-random IP IDs, that is, it is\npossible to predict the next value of the ip_id field of\nthe ip packets sent by this host.\n\nAn attacker may use this feature to determine traffic patterns\nwithin your network.   A few examples (not at all exhaustive) are:\n \n1. A remote attacker can determine if the remote host sent a packet \nin reply to another request.  Specifically, an attacker can use your \nserver as an unwilling participant in a blind portscan of another \nnetwork.  \n\n2. A remote attacker can roughly determine server requests at certain \ntimes of the day.  For instance, if the server is sending much more \ntraffic after business hours, the server may be a reverse proxy or \nother remote access device.  An attacker can use this information to\nconcentrate his/her efforts on the more critical machines.\n\n3. A remote attacker can roughly estimate the number of requests that \na web server processes over a period of time.\n\n\nSolution : Contact your vendor for a patch\nRisk factor : Low\n
