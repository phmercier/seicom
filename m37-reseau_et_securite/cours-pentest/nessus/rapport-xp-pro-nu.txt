 . Vulnerability found on port epmap (135/tcp) : 


    
    The remote host is running a version of Windows which has a flaw in 
    its RPC interface which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code 
    and gain SYSTEM privileges.  There is at least one Worm which is 
    currently exploiting this vulnerability.  Namely, the MsBlaster worm.
     
     Solution: see
     http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.mspx 
     Risk factor : High
    CVE : CAN-2003-0352
    BID : 8205
    Other references : IAVA:2003-A-0011

 . Warning found on port epmap (135/tcp)


    
    Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) services running on the remote host 
    can be enumerated by connecting on port 135 and doing the appropriate
     queries. 
    
    An attacker may use this fact to gain more knowledge
    about the remote host.
    
    Solution : filter incoming traffic to this port.
    Risk factor : Low

 . Information found on port blackjack (1025/tcp)


    Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) services running on the remote host
    can be enumerated by connecting on port 135 and doing the appropriate
     queries.
    
    An attacker may use this fact to gain more knowledge
    about the remote host.
    
    
    Here is the list of DCE services running on this port:
    
         UUID: 1ff70682-0a51-30e8-076d-740be8cee98b, version 1
         Endpoint: ncacn_ip_tcp:172.31.7.211[1025]
         Named pipe : atsvc
         Win32 service or process : mstask.exe
         Description : Scheduler service
    
         UUID: 378e52b0-c0a9-11cf-822d-00aa0051e40f, version 1
         Endpoint: ncacn_ip_tcp:172.31.7.211[1025]
    
         UUID: 0a74ef1c-41a4-4e06-83ae-dc74fb1cdd53, version 1
         Endpoint: ncacn_ip_tcp:172.31.7.211[1025]
    
         UUID: 5a7b91f8-ff00-11d0-a9b2-00c04fb6e6fc, version 1
         Endpoint: ncacn_ip_tcp:172.31.7.211[1025]
         Annotation: Messenger Service
         Named pipe : ntsvcs
         Win32 service or process : messenger
         Description : Messenger service
    
    
    
    Solution : filter incoming traffic to this port.
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port netbios-ns (137/udp)


    The following 7 NetBIOS names have been gathered :
     XP-PRO-VBOX     = This is the computer name registered for workstation
     services by a WINS client.
     WORKGROUP       = Workgroup / Domain name
     XP-PRO-VBOX     = This is the current logged in user registered for this
     workstation.
     XP-PRO-VBOX     = Computer name
     WORKGROUP       = Workgroup / Domain name (part of the Browser elections)
     WORKGROUP      
       __MSBROWSE__ 
    The remote host has the following MAC address on its adapter :
       08:00:27:14:3d:e5
    
    If you do not want to allow everyone to find the NetBios name
    of your computer, you should filter incoming traffic to this port.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    CVE : CAN-1999-0621

 . Warning found on port general/tcp


    
    The remote host uses non-random IP IDs, that is, it is
    possible to predict the next value of the ip_id field of
    the ip packets sent by this host.
    
    An attacker may use this feature to determine traffic patterns
    within your network.   A few examples (not at all exhaustive) are:
     
    1. A remote attacker can determine if the remote host sent a packet 
    in reply to another request.  Specifically, an attacker can use your 
    server as an unwilling participant in a blind portscan of another 
    network.  
    
    2. A remote attacker can roughly determine server requests at certain 
    times of the day.  For instance, if the server is sending much more 
    traffic after business hours, the server may be a reverse proxy or 
    other remote access device.  An attacker can use this information to
    concentrate his/her efforts on the more critical machines.
    
    3. A remote attacker can roughly estimate the number of requests that 
    a web server processes over a period of time.
    
    
    Solution : Contact your vendor for a patch
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port general/tcp


    
    The remote host accepts loose source routed IP packets.
    The feature was designed for testing purpose.
    An attacker may use it to circumvent poorly designed IP filtering 
    and exploit another flaw. However, it is not dangerous by itself.
    
    Solution : drop source routed packets on this host or on other ingress 
    routers or firewalls.  
    
    
    Risk factor : Low
